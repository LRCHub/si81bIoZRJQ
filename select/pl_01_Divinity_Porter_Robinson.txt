Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
We will wait for this
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
Lean into my side
Never felt alive
Call the chance and sigh
You see right through me
